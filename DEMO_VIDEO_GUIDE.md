# Facebook App Review - Demo Video Guide

This guide outlines the necessary steps and shots for the demo video to showcase the Facebook Login integration and its usage within the live chat application.

**Objective:** Demonstrate how the application uses Facebook Login for user authentication, displays user information obtained from Facebook, and how this identity is used within the chat feature, while respecting data privacy.

---

## I. Introduction & Initial State (User Not Logged In)

1.  **[SHOT]** Start with the website's main page.
    *   **Narration/Text Overlay:** "This is our website, [Your Website Name/URL]."
2.  **[SHOT]** Clearly show that the user is currently not logged in.
    *   Point out the "Login with Facebook" button.
    *   Point out any UI elements indicating a logged-out state (e.g., no user name displayed, chat feature disabled/hidden).
    *   **Narration/Text Overlay:** "Currently, the user is not logged in. The live chat feature is [disabled/hidden]."

## II. Facebook Login Process

3.  **[SHOT]** User clicks the "Login with Facebook" button.
    *   **Narration/Text Overlay:** "The user clicks 'Login with Facebook' to authenticate."
4.  **[SHOT]** Briefly show the Facebook authentication dialog/redirect.
    *   *Note: Keep this part brief. Focus on your website's interaction, not the details of Facebook's UI, unless specifically required to show permissions.*
    *   **Narration/Text Overlay:** "The user authenticates with their Facebook account."
5.  **[SHOT]** User is redirected back to your website, now in a logged-in state.
    *   **Narration/Text Overlay:** "After successful authentication, the user is redirected back to our site."

## III. Post-Login State & Viewing User Info

6.  **[SHOT]** Highlight UI changes indicating the user is logged in.
    *   Show the "Login with Facebook" button is now hidden.
    *   Show the "Logout" button is now visible.
7.  **[SHOT]** **Crucial:** Clearly show where the user's Facebook information is displayed.
    *   Focus on the element displaying the user's name (e.g., `#user-info` in the header).
    *   **Narration/Text Overlay:** "The user is now logged in. Their Facebook name, [User's Displayed Name], is shown here, confirming their identity from Facebook."
    *   **(Privacy Statement - Point 1)** **Narration/Text Overlay:** "Our application uses Facebook Login for authentication and to identify the user for our live chat service."
    *   **(Privacy Statement - Point 2)** **Narration/Text Overlay:** "The name displayed, [User's Displayed Name], is provided by Facebook as part of the login process."

## IV. Accessing and Using the Live Chat Feature

8.  **[SHOT]** Show the live chat widget/button now being active or visible.
    *   **Narration/Text Overlay:** "Logging in enables the live chat feature."
9.  **[SHOT]** User opens/clicks the live chat widget.
10. **[SHOT]** User types a message into the chat input field.
    *   **Narration/Text Overlay:** "The user can now send messages through the live chat."
11. **[SHOT]** User sends the message, and it appears in their chat window.
    *   **(Privacy Statement - Point 3)** **Narration/Text Overlay:** "Chat messages are linked to this Facebook identity to facilitate communication. We do not request or store additional sensitive personal information from the user via Facebook."

## V. (Optional but Recommended) Backend/Admin Context

12. **[SHOT - Optional, Brief]** If easily accessible and clear, briefly show:
    *   **Option A:** A Discord notification generated by a user's message, showing the message content and the user's identifier (e.g., "Message from [Facebook User Name/ID]: Hello!").
    *   **Option B:** The admin chat panel where a staff member sees the incoming message associated with the client's Facebook name or ID.
    *   **Narration/Text Overlay (if shown):** "This identity is used to associate the user with their conversation, allowing our support staff to assist them."
    *   *Keep this very brief â€“ the focus is on the user-facing aspects for Facebook review.*

## VI. Logout (Optional, but good for completeness)

13. **[SHOT - Optional]** User clicks the "Logout" button.
14. **[SHOT - Optional]** UI reverts to the logged-out state (as shown in Step 2).
    *   **Narration/Text Overlay (if shown):** "The user can log out, which removes their session from our website."

**Key Reminders for Recording:**

*   **Clarity:** Ensure screen recording is clear and easy to follow. Zoom in on relevant UI elements.
*   **Pacing:** Allow enough time for viewers to see each step clearly.
*   **Audio/Text:** Use clear voiceover or legible text overlays to explain each step and convey the required privacy information.
*   **Edit:** Edit out any unnecessary pauses or mistakes.
*   **Focus on Requirements:** Prioritize showing the elements Facebook specifically asks for: login button, Facebook auth flow, display of Facebook user data (name), and how it relates to the app's functionality (chat).
*   **Privacy Statements:** Ensure the narration/text overlays regarding data use and privacy are included as specified.
