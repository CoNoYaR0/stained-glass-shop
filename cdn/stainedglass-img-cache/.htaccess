<IfModule mod_headers.c>
  # Header directives removed due to mod_headers unavailability on the server.
  # For static image files, if CORS is needed and mod_headers is unavailable,
  # alternative server configurations (e.g., at a higher level if on dedicated/VPS)
  # or a PHP script to serve images would be required to set these headers.
  # However, images are often less strict about CORS for direct embedding via <img> tags.
